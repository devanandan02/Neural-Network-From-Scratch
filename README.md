<h2>Neural Network From Scratch</h2>
<br>
Neural Network is a type of Machine Learning rocess called Deep Learning which uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure, that resembles human neuron system.
<br><br>
The KeyConcepts.md file contains the brief definitions of all the important concepts in Neural Network.
<br><br>
The Iris_class_prediction.ipynb file contains the implementation of a neural network model applied to the Iris dataset. The code demonstrates the neural network architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics specific to the Iris dataset.

<h2>Neural Network From Scratch</h2>
<br>
Machine Learning Steps(basic)
<br><br>
1. Feed input -> Data flow from layer to layer -> Retrieve output
<br>
2. Calculate the error (cost function/ loss function)
<br>
3. Adjust the parameter using the optimization function
<br>
4. Start again
<br><br>
The important step is 3 because it's where the learning happens

The .ipynb file contains the implementation of a neural network model applied to the Iris dataset. The code demonstrates the neural network architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics specific to the Iris dataset.

<ins>Layer</ins> : Layers are like different levels of processing that information goes through. There are 3 types of layers input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.
<br><br>
<ins>Forward Propogation</ins> : It is a process of receiveing weighted input, transforms it with a set of mostly non-linear functions and then passes these values as output to the next layer.
<br><br>
<ins>Backward Propogaation</ins> : It is the process that adjusts the weights of the network's connections in order to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual target values.
<br><br>
<ins>Dense Layer</ins> : It connects n input neurons to a set of m output neurons. The value of n is the number of features and m is the numbers of classes for classification problem and for regression m = 1. Dense layer is a fully connected layer

#Neural Network From Scratch
<br>
Machine Learning Steps(basic)
<br>
1. Feed input -> Data flow from layer to layer -> Retrieve output
<br>
2. Calculate the error (cost function/ loss function)
<br>
3. Adjust the parameter using optimization function
<br>
4. Start again
<br>
The important step is 3 because it's where the learning happens.

<h2>Neural Network From Scratch</h2>
<br>
Machine Learning Steps(basic)
<br><br>
1. Feed input -> Data flow from layer to layer -> Retrieve output
<br>
2. Calculate the error (cost function/ loss function)
<br>
3. Adjust the parameter using the optimization function
<br>
4. Start again
<br><br>
The important step is 3 because it's where the learning happens

<h5>Defenitions</h5>
<br>
<ins>Layer</ins> : Layers are like different levels of processing that information goes through. There are 3 types of layers input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.
<br><br>
<u>Forward Propogation</u> : It is a process of receiveing weighted input, transforms it with a set of mostly non-linear functions and then passes these values as output to the next layer.
<br><br>
<u>Backward Propogaation</u> : It is the process that adjusts the weights of the network's connections in order to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual target values.
